pip install pyocd

helpful info:

Hijack the builtin support for max32660 because I could not get custom target to work

path to pyocd bultin after pip installing:
~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyocd/target/builtin

running the command below will print the variable live as it changes
without messing with ble timing. 
python pyocd_test.py

next steps would be to move svd file here and parse it,
and then parse elf file to get memory addresses of variables.
